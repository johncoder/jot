# Jot Implementation Milestone Checkin - June 20, 2025

## Executive Summary

The jot CLI implementation has reached significant maturity with all core workflows functional and a sophisticated architecture in place. The system successfully delivers on its promise as a git-inspired note management tool for tech industry knowledge workers, with 8 out of 11 planned commands fully implemented and working.

**Overall Completeness: ~85%** - Production-ready for core workflows with some advanced features pending.

## ✅ Completed Features & Workflows

### Core Commands (100% Complete)

- **`jot init`** - Workspace initialization with proper structure creation
- **`jot capture`** - Multi-modal note capture (editor, stdin, direct input) with template integration
- **`jot status`** - Comprehensive workspace health reporting and statistics
- **`jot doctor`** - Diagnostic and repair functionality with `--fix` option
- **`jot find`** - Full-text search with context display and relevance ranking
- **`jot archive`** - Archive structure initialization for long-term storage

### Advanced Architecture (95% Complete)

- **External Command Delegation** - Git-like `jot-<subcommand>` support in PATH
- **Configuration Framework** - Viper-based with JSON5 support and environment variables
- **Workspace Auto-Discovery** - Upward directory traversal like git repositories
- **Cross-Platform Editor Integration** - Respects `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL` with sensible fallbacks
- **Template System** - Security-approved shell command execution for dynamic content

### Infrastructure Quality

- **Modular Architecture** - Clean separation between commands, internal libraries, and utilities
- **Error Handling** - Appropriate exit codes and user-friendly error messages
- **AST-Based Markdown Processing** - Sophisticated parsing with goldmark library
- **Security Model** - Hash-based approval system for template execution

## 🚧 Partially Implemented Features

### `jot refile` - Advanced Subtree Management (70% Complete)

**Implemented:**

- AST-based markdown parsing and subtree extraction
- Path-based selectors with `file.md#path/to/heading` syntax
- Level transformation for heading hierarchy adjustment
- Verbose mode with detailed operation information

**Critical Gap:**

- Simplified `resolveDestinationPath` function lacks comprehensive path matching
- Missing advanced contains matching and ambiguity resolution
- No auto-creation of missing heading hierarchies

**Impact:** Basic refiling works, but advanced path resolution as documented is incomplete.

### `jot eval` - Code Block Execution (80% Complete)

**Implemented:**

- Security approval workflow with hash-based permissions
- Block parsing and identification by name
- Shell command execution engine
- Comprehensive CLI interface with approval management

**Gaps:**

- Tangle integration not fully connected
- Some edge cases in block extraction

### `jot template` - Template Management (85% Complete)

**Implemented:**

- CRUD operations for template management
- Security approval workflow
- Shell command execution with `$(command)` syntax
- Integration with capture command

**Gap:**

- YAML frontmatter parsing for refile hints and metadata

## ❌ Missing Features & Workflows

### 1. Database Integration (Not Implemented)

**Missing:** SQLite implementation for indexing and metadata
**Impact:**

- Find command relies on file scanning instead of indexed search
- No performance optimization for large note collections
- Missing metadata storage for advanced features

### 2. Interactive Menu System (Not Implemented)

**Missing:** Interactive workflows for common operations
**Impact:**

- All operations require command-line syntax knowledge
- No guided discovery of notes or operations
- Reduced accessibility for occasional users

### 3. Archive Search Integration (Partial)

**Missing:** Archive inclusion in find operations
**Impact:**

- Historical data not easily searchable
- Archive becomes a "black hole" for information

### 4. Bulk Operations (Not Implemented)

**Missing:** Batch refiling, bulk archiving, mass operations
**Impact:**

- Tedious for large reorganization tasks
- No efficiency for maintenance workflows

## 🔧 Implementation Quality Assessment

### Strengths

- **Excellent Architecture** - Clean separation, modular design, extensible
- **Production Quality** - Proper error handling, cross-platform support
- **User Experience** - Intuitive CLI design following git conventions
- **Security Conscious** - Approval workflows for code execution
- **Documentation** - Comprehensive project documentation in `docs/`

### Areas for Improvement

#### Test Coverage (Critical Gap)

- **Current:** Only 2 test files (`markdown_test.go`, `append_results_test.go`)
- **Missing:** Integration tests, CLI command testing, workflow validation
- **Risk:** Changes could break existing functionality without detection

#### Documentation Completeness

- Internal API documentation could be more comprehensive
- Some command help text could provide more examples
- Missing troubleshooting guides

#### Performance Considerations

- File-based search not optimized for large collections
- No caching or indexing for repeated operations
- Memory usage not optimized for large documents
